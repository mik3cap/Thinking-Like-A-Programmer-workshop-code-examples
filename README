Anyone and everyone can write their own programs! If you've ever
cooked following a recipe, you can program. If you've ever solved a
puzzle, you can program. If you've ever played a game - you can
program! Learn the basic concepts of computers, information
processing, and modern programming languages from a pro and empower
yourself with a set of problem solving tools you can apply to any
situation. Students at all skill levels are welcome, though beginners
will benefit most from this study. No experience is required other
than a strong desire to learn how to program.

Students will walk out of this workshop having learned many of the
fundamental concepts of modern programming languages. They will gain a
basic working knowledge of the Python programming language, and will
take with them the mental framework needed to approach problems
logically and atomically. Please note that this workshop is not about
"building web sites" or using HTML or other markup languages or any
other form of "front end design"; Python is best described as a "back
end" technology and is all about how technology works "under the
hood".

MacBooks with Mac OS 10.4 or greater or a Unix based computer are
recommended, because they already come pre-installed with all the
tools you need to get started programming immediately. If you are
using a Windows PC you must install Python - this applies ONLY to
Windows PCs. The self-installing Python version you need to download
can be found at this link:

http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2.msi

Next you will need to follow the instructions under the sections
"Finding python.exe" and "Finding your script files", as written in
the tutorial found here:

The "Thinking Like A Programmer" workshop is regularly held at locations in
New York, New York. See the workshop places, schedules, and times here:
