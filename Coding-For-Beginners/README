Welcome to our hands-on, intensive, one day workshop. You will leave here 
today with all the technical tools and knowledge you need to read and write 
your own software! If you have not yet registered, you can do so here:

IMPORTANT NOTES:

    1. This workshop is not about building websites.

    2. Register before 3:00p.m. the Friday before the workshop day. You must 
    register before then, no exceptions or walk-ins.

    3. You should bring an ID for building security to check on the workshop 
    day, as they will have a list of attendees.

You will soon understand the basic concepts of computers, information 
processing, and modern programming languages empower yourself with a set of 
problem solving tools you can apply to any situation. Students at all skill 
levels are welcome, though beginners will benefit most from this study. No 
experience is required other than a strong desire to learn how to program! 
Students will walk out of this workshop having learned the following:

    - The history of computers, from ancient to modern times

    - How a modern computer works, from hardware to software

    - Working with your computer's operating system using commands

    - Installing a package manager to install programming tools (Homebrew)

    - Programming language basics and using an interpreter

    - Creating programs using step-by-step outlines

    - Researching and reading documentation

    - Installing third party software libraries

    - A brief introduction to advanced programming concepts

Please note that this workshop is not about "building web sites" or using HTML 
or other markup languages or any other form of "front end design"; Python is 
best described as a "back end" technology and the workshop is all about how 
computers work "under the hood" with programming.

You must bring a laptop. MacBooks with Mac OS X (10.4 or greater) preferred 
because they already come pre-installed with all the tools you need to get 
started programming immediately. Step by step instructions will be provided 
prior to start of the workshop to help you get your laptop ready for 
programming if you don't have a Mac. Attendees will not be able to follow 
along with learning Unix commands if they're working on a Windows laptop. 
Please arrive at 11:00a.m. sharp if you think you will need help with your 
laptop's setup!

If you have a Windows PC, the self-installing Python version you need
to download can be found here:

https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.8/python-2.7.8.msi

Next you will need to follow the instructions appropriate for your
Windows OS version to set your Windows PATH:

- Windows 7/8
  + Select Computer from the Start menu

  + Choose System Properties from the context menu

  + Click Advanced system settings > Advanced tab

  + Click on Environment Variables, under System Variables, find PATH, and click on it.

  + In the Edit windows, modify PATH by adding:
    C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts; to the value for PATH. If you do
    not have the item PATH, you may add a new variable with PATH as
    the name and C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts; as the value.

  + Reopen Command prompt window, and type in python to check if the
    PATH variable is set correctly.


- Windows XP

  + Start -> Control Panel -> System -> Advanced

  + Click on Environment Variables, under System Variables, find PATH, and click on it.

  + In the Edit windows, modify PATH by adding:
    C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts; to the value for PATH. If you do
    not have the item PATH, you may add a new variable with PATH as
    the name and C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts; as the value.

  + Reopen Command prompt window, and type in python to check if the
    PATH variable is set correctly.


- Windows Vista
  + Right click My Computer icon

  + Choose Properties from the context menu

  + Click Advanced tab (Advanced system settings link in Vista)

  + In the Edit windows, modify PATH by adding:
    C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts; to the value for PATH. If you do
    not have the item PATH, you may add a new variable with PATH as
    the name and C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts; as the value.

  + Reopen Command prompt window, and type in python to check if the
    PATH variable is set correctly.


Light and healthy refreshments will be served during the workshop, but please 
bring a bag lunch if you have any dietary restrictions, allergies, or other 
requirements - there will be a short break to eat lunch.
