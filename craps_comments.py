# Keep prompting for rolls until the game is over

    # Let the player hit return to roll the dice

    # Roll two dice

    # If it is the first roll declare the point

        # Set the point

    # Else

        # Check the result to see if it matches the point

                # If it is 7 or 11 and player bet pass, they lose

                # If it is 7 or 11 and player bet don't pass, they win

        # The result matches the point

                # The player makes the point and bet pass - a win

                # The player makes the point and bet don't pass - they lose

        # No result matches point or is 7, 11 yet - keep rolling!
